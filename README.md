# f256_dcopy

A tool for the Foenix 256K and Jr. which allows to copy files from one drive to another. Of course
it also works for copying files to another location on the same drive. 

Use the provided `makefile` to build the program as a `.pgz` file which can be started through `pexec`. 
You will need `64tass` and a `python3` interpreter in your path for the `makefile` to work.
